                          description: NoProxy can contain a comma separated list
                            of hosts to which all components can connect without using
                            a proxy. If set, it'll result in an additional NO_PROXY
                            environment variable defined for all components. When
                            a component already has NO_PROXY defined through the CRD,
                            NoProxy won't be used, using the component's original
                            NO_PROXY value instead.

                          description: NoProxySuffix can be an empty string or contain
                            a comma separated list of hosts which can be safely appended
                            to the `NoProxy` values or to the component specific NO_PROXY
                            environment variable. NoProxySuffix is defaulted to a
                            list of the Kubernetes API server IP addresses and to
                            the service domain suffix of the installation namespace
                            (usually cbcontainers-dataplane.svc.cluster.local). It's
                            exposed more as a means by which to control the defaults.
